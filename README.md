# bus routes

This is a simple program written in Java which provided some background into constructing graphs. The idea is to create a path from start to finish for the bus to follow, while keeping in mind the allotted bus changes for the particular map. 

This program takes as input (command line argument / program argument for eclipse intellij etc..) a text file corresponding to a map. I have provided a few examples. 

### The map input file:

The first line contains 4 numbers. Where the first number corresponds to the number of nodes in the graph.

The second number corresponds to the number of bus changes allowed in solution.

The third number corresponds to the width of the map (number of nodes across.

The fourth number corresponds to the length of the map (number of nodes in acolumn of the graph.

'S' corresponds to the starting node, and 'D' corresponds to the destination node.

'.' corresponds to an intersection, and ' ' corresponds to a block of houses.
